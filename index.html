                <h2>A little bit about me.</h2>
                <div class="half-width">
                    <p>I've made my home base in Ann Arbor, MI. My journey into
                        tech started with a degree in Communication Studies at The University of Michigan. I have always been interested in problem solving 
                        and how to communicate clearly with words and imagery. </p>
                </div>
                <div class="half-width">
                    <p>I work on a freelance basis with a particular focus on bringing the dreams of small business owners into reality. Building user-friendly ways for my clients to communicate their message and
                    help their customers take action makes me very happy.</p>

                    <h3>Hand-Coded HTML</h3>
                    <p>My handwritten, semantic HTML5 code is clean and well formatted to make sure that the content
                        is easy to read, easy to collaborate, trouble-shoot and accessible.</p>
                </div>

                    <img src="img/css-icon.png" alt="CSS icon" />
                    <h3>Well-Organized CSS</h3>
                    <p>I pride myself on writing CSS that is easy to read and build on. I focus on keeping my CSS lean
                        and fast to load, and I make it a habit to stay up to date on current best practices.</p>

                    <h3>Ease Converting Designs into Code</h3>
                    <p>You can trust me to take a designer's PSD and quickly &amp; accurately convert it into a webpage
                        that is pixel-perfect match.  Or I can design it for you!</p>
